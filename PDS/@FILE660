//***FILE 660 is from Gerhard Postpischil and contains a REXX exec  *   FILE 660
//*           which runs other REXX execs through the REXX compiler *   FILE 660
//*           (in a dry run) and checks them for errors.  This exec *   FILE 660
//*           is called REXXER, and you run it as an edit macro,    *   FILE 660
//*           while you're editing a REXX exec that you want to     *   FILE 660
//*           check.  REXXER will run the compiler, and flag the    *   FILE 660
//*           errors that are on each line, as message note lines.  *   FILE 660
//*                                                                 *   FILE 660
